Done during the first 2 months of my graduate studies, before I made my decision to leave. Even though this is an incomplete work, I have toiled through some very tedious mathematics involving differentials that a graduate physics student may find helpful as references for Quantum Mechanics (and maybe even Quantum Field Theory). Access the [pdf](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://github.com/zlian001/zlian001.github.io/raw/master/_pdf/intro_spintronics.pdf).
