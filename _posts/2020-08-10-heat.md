The explicit forward time, centered space (FTCS) scheme, as well as the implicit backward time, centered space (BTCS), and Crank-Nicolson (CN) schemes are developed for a simple problem involving the one-dimensional heat equation. Working Python 3 codes for each scheme are also presented (please wait for an update to this post for the code listings), with the results of running the codes on finer meshes, and with smaller time steps being demonstrated. These sample calculations realize the theoretical predictions of the relationship of truncation errors and stability limits on spatial and temporal discretisation step size.
