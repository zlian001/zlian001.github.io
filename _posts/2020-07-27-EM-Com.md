Part of my self-initiated final year thesis project. I designed a coursework to teach scientific computation to physicists at the undergraduate level. These materials were developed for the absolute beginner, yet careful attention was paid to keep the content rigorous and demanding. Although the worked examples were tailored to the context of undergraduate electromagnetism, non-scientists might find the generalised concepts of numerical methods beneficial and relatively easy to understand. Access the interactive [jupyter file](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zlian001/zlian001.github.io/master?filepath=_pdf%2Fem_comp.ipynb) (binder docker image may take a while to launch on the first instance - 3 mins). Also available in [pdf](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://github.com/zlian001/zlian001.github.io/raw/master/_pdf/em_comp.pdf) (static).
