Part of my self-initiated final year thesis project. I designed a coursework to teach scientific computation to physicists at the undergraduate level. The materials were developed for the absolute beginner, yet careful attention was given to still keep the content rigorous and demanding. Although the worked examples were tailored to the context of undergraduate electromagnetism, non-scientists might find the generalised concepts of numerical methods beneficial and easy to understand. Access the interactive [jupyter file](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zlian001/zlian001.github.io/master?filepath=_pdf%2Fem_comp.ipynb)(binder docker image may take a while to launch). Also available in [pdf](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://github.com/zlian001/zlian001.github.io/raw/master/_pdf/em_comp.pdf)(non-interactive).
