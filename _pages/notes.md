Some notes (may be related to math/physics/computing/financial modelling/anything that happened to interest me enough really) written by me that I think will be beneficial (or not) to the internet traffic. You can expect more releases in the near future (subject to my schedule and amount of editorial work needed for at least a decent read). My notes are typeset with LaTeX, .tex files are available upon reasonable request.
