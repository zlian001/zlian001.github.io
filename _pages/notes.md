Some notes (related to math/physics/computing/financial modelling/anything that happened to interest me) that are written by me which I think will be beneficial (or not) to the internet traffic. You can expect more releases in the near future (subject to my schedule and amount of editorial work needed for at least a decent read). My pdf notes are typeset with LaTeX, and the corresponding .tex files are available upon reasonable request.
