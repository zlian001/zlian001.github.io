I am a university graduate in the 2020 Covid-19 global pandemic -- a helpless physicist on the sidelines envious of his peers in the healthcare industry making a direct impact on human lives. Unemployed after passing up a scholarship for graduate studies (you can ask me why), I was a walking caricature of "the nerd living in his mum's basement". Not willing to be outdone by my higher-achieving peers, I started delivering essential items to at-risk families in my community with my trusty [pal](/images/hb.jpg). Come [join](https://www.foodfromtheheart.sg/tour/individual-volunteer/sign-up.php) me and say hi!

My personal interests outside of physics include: reading editorials and opinion pieces; sports (in a very distant past, I did western boxing and was into rock climbing); and assembling Lego toy models. To add to my already square and boring disposition, I also delight in implementing solutions to hypothetical problem situations using code, as well as unnecessary tinkering with my raspberry pi model 3. I love Stephen Chow comedies, 80s Cantonese music, both soft and hard rock, wind on my face, and the occasional Netflix sitcoms.
